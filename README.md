# retails-sales-project

Through this project, we are trying to provide a local chain, Costello Ace with insights that will
help them with their business from the market basket data provided. The store operates 30+
stores and is spread across Long Island, Brooklyn, Staten Island, New Jersey and Maryland.
The insights will help them to make customer-centric, strategic and operational decisions. More
specifically we are trying to help them with the following decisions -
<ul> 
  <li> Which products to promote? </li>
<li> Which products to place near other products,?</li>
<li> Which products to stock?</li>
<li> Which to recommend to specific customers?</li>
 </ul>
To gain a comprehensive view of business results and to improve operational performance
across storeâ€™s locations, we are also looking to analyze store level data to ensure customer
experience across differential community requirements are met by identifying location specific
trends and seasonal trends to maximize revenue.
